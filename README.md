First attempt to unified universe go wrong, 
but was my inspiration for next improvements.

My initial thoughts on the possibilities of unifying forces and 
incorporating new principles of physics into Einstein's equations. 
Substitution of the established Einstein cosmological constant.

Trying to use our newest theory
Verlinde entropic gravity, quantum principle of particle entanglement, 
EP=EPR principles, Hawking's theory of information leakage
from a black hole or black hole radiation and some ideas of string M-theory.

The final outputs and calculations were wrong and did not correspond to observations of the universe and the results of general relativity. Furthermore, it was not explained how the continuous, gradual distribution of matter and vacuum-dark energy took place in all time phases of the universe from its birth to the present day. This led me to the idea of introducing a PID controller into the equations in the new proposal for a solution to unification. The assumption was that the parameters kp, Ki, ks of the controller tuning were not set by an external entity, but that it was a self-regulating ability of the universe as such. Subsequently, something strange began to form. 

how are we to begin to imagine the strange entropy of the vacuum, entropic gravity, the emergence of particles and fields from these strange fluctuations. The idea of storing information somewhere in hyperspace according to holographic principles. We will have to gradually overcome these paradigm shifts and try to find suitable analogies to explain to the general public.
